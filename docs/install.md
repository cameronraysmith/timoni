    ```shell
    yay -S timoni
    ```

    If you prefer to use the upstream binaries:

    ```shell

    ```

=== "zypper"

    Install the latest release with [zypper](https://github.com/openSUSE/zypper) for openSUSE:
    
    ```shell
    zypper install timoni
    ```

    To setup shell autocompletion:

    ```shell
    zypper install timoni-bash-completion
    zypper install timoni-fish-completion
    zypper install timoni-zsh-completion
    ```
=== "proto"

    Manage multiple versions with [proto](https://moonrepo.dev/proto) for all supported systems:

    ```toml
    # .prototools file

    timoni = "0.19.0"

    [plugins]
    timoni = "source:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stefanprodan/timoni/main/proto-plugin.toml"
    ```

=== "from source"

    Using Go >= 1.21:
    
    ```shell
    go install github.com/stefanprodan/timoni/cmd/timoni@latest
    ```

## Shell autocompletion

Configure your shell to load timoni completions:

=== "Bash"

    To load completion run:
    
    ```shell
    . <(timoni completion bash)
    ```

    To configure your bash shell to load completions for each session add to your bashrc:

    ```shell
    # ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
    command -v timoni >/dev/null && . <(timoni completion bash)
    ```

    If you have an alias for timoni, you can extend shell completion to work with that alias:

    ```shell
    # ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
    alias tm=timoni
    complete -F __start_timoni tm
    ```

=== "Fish"

    To configure your fish shell to [load completions](http://fishshell.com/docs/current/index.html#completion-own)
    for each session write this script to your completions dir:
    
    ```shell
    timoni completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/timoni.fish
    ```

=== "Powershell"

    To load completion run:

    ```shell
    . <(timoni completion powershell)
    ```

    To configure your powershell shell to load completions for each session add to your powershell profile:
    
    Windows:

    ```shell
    cd "$env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules"
    timoni completion >> timoni-completion.ps1
    ```
    Linux:

    ```shell
    cd "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-"$HOME/.config/"}/powershell/modules"
    timoni completion >> timoni-completions.ps1
    ```

=== "Zsh"

    To load completion run:
    
    ```shell
    . <(timoni completion zsh) && compdef _timoni timoni
    ```

    To configure your zsh shell to load completions for each session add to your zshrc:
    
    ```shell
    # ~/.zshrc or ~/.profile
    command -v timoni >/dev/null && . <(timoni completion zsh) && compdef _timoni timoni
    ```

    or write a cached file in one of the completion directories in your ${fpath}:
    
    ```shell
    echo "${fpath// /\n}" | grep -i completion
    timoni completion zsh > _timoni
    
    mv _timoni ~/.oh-my-zsh/completions  # oh-my-zsh
    mv _timoni ~/.zprezto/modules/completion/external/src/  # zprezto
    ```

## Local cache

Timoni maintains a local cache of modules pulled from remote container registries.
Cashing is meant to reduce network traffic for sequential pull operations and speeds up
applying bundles which refer to modules with identical layers.

The default cache location is `$HOME/.timoni/cache` and can be changed with either the
`--cache-dir` global flag or `TIMONI_CACHE_DIR` environment variable. The global flag
takes precedence over the environment variable.

If the home directory is not writable, caching can be disabled by
setting the `TIMONI_CACHING=false` environment variable.

## SLSA Provenance & SBOMs

The build, release and provenance portions of Timoni's supply chain meet the
[SLSA Build Level 3](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/levels) requirements.

The release artifacts are produced on GitHub-hosted runners using
[GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) and the provenance generation is handled by the official
[SLSA GitHub Generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator).

To verify a release artifact such as the Timoni binary tarball,
you can use the [slsa-verifier](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier) tool:

```shell
TIMONI_VER=0.10.0 && \
gh release download v${TIMONI_VER} -R=stefanprodan/timoni -p="*" && \
slsa-verifier verify-artifact \
--provenance-path timoni_${TIMONI_VER}_provenance.intoto.jsonl \
--source-uri github.com/stefanprodan/timoni  \
--source-tag v${TIMONI_VER} \
timoni_${TIMONI_VER}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz
```

Each release comes with a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) in [SPDX](https://spdx.dev) format.
The SBOMs are generated on GitHub-hosted runners using
[GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) and [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft).

To scan a release for vulnerabilities, you can use [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype):

```shell
TIMONI_VER=0.10.0 && \
gh release download v${TIMONI_VER} -R=stefanprodan/timoni -p="*sbom.spdx.json" && \
grype sbom:./timoni_${TIMONI_VER}_sbom.spdx.json
```
